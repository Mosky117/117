# 117 
The website is made of 3 pages:
- Home, a short introduction of myself;
- Resume, where you can read my skills and experiences;
- Contacts, where it's located a form which allow you to send me an email.

Every index file is stored inside its respective folder, while the other files are stored in the assets folder.
For the contacts page I used a footer to link my social profiles and to send email with the form I used the EmailJS tool.
In assets/js folder you can see a script.js, that's just a script that allow the user to navigate by all pages using the arrow keys of the keyboard.
